        "body": "Interested in making your own classic Roblox clothing, but frustrated by the lack of reliable, free tools? Many people want to design shirts, pants and outfits for their avatars, games or groups, but they face the same problems: outdated websites, broken generators, low-quality templates or confusing systems that no longer work as they used to. Many older services relied on external APIs and technologies that Roblox has replaced, meaning they have stopped working or now only provide downgraded images. Because of this, finding a working, flawless template can be surprisingly difficult. \n This is exactly the problem Threadline was created to solve. \n Threadline is a modern platform designed specifically for classic Roblox clothing creators. Instead of giving you compressed 420×420 images, Threadline directly accesses Roblox's classic clothing files and downloads them in their true original size: 585×559. This means sharper lines, more details and templates that load cleanly without stretching or smearing. No more converting, resizing or fixing broken files yourself – Threadline does all the hard work in the background. \n You can use Threadline in two convenient ways: through the website or through a completely free browser extension. With the extension installed, simply go to any Classic Clothing listing on Roblox and you'll see a \"Download with Threadline\" button right below the Add to Cart option. You can also click the thread icon in your browser's toolbar to trigger the download. All it takes is one click to save the template in full quality directly to your device, without watermarks and without extra steps. \n If you don't want to use the extension, the website is just as simple. Go to the Threadline home page, paste the URL or ID of the Roblox clothing item into the text box and press download. In just a few seconds, you will receive a full resolution template, ready for editing and uploading. No registration or payment required. \n Threadline isn't just a downloader either. It also offers a growing library of useful features for creators. You can download group templates, create custom backgrounds, organize your assets for future uploads, and access optional sponsorship tools built right into the site. These sponsorship features allow your games, UGC elements, groups and GamePass to be promoted seamlessly within the platform, helping you reach more players and customers without complicated ad setup. \n Every download from Threadline Premium is watermark-free, meaning your finished clothes look clean and professional. Whether you're designing for personal use, running a clothing line, or creating a game that uses uniforms or outfits, Threadline streamlines the process from start to finish. This reduces the usual hassle of finding working templates, converting images or dealing with broken devices. \n In short, Threadline is a free, highly accessible, and rapidly growing platform designed to make it easier than ever to create classic Roblox clothing. If you want a reliable way to download full-size templates and support your creative projects, Threadline gives you the tools to do it quickly and easily—without hidden fees or unnecessary complications.",

        {"title": "How To Test Your Roblox Clothes Without Wasting Robux", 
        "body": "Have you ever gone on a clothing-creation spree for Roblox, full of motivation and inspiration, designing new patterns, color combinations, templates, and outfits for your group or game—only to discover after uploading that each item cost you 10 Robux and several of them contained small mistakes you didn’t notice beforehand? Those tiny imperfections can quickly add up, turning into hundreds of Robux wasted on items you are not proud of and that your customers won’t be satisfied with either. \n Fortunately, this has a very simple solution. \n Imagine you create a set of Classic Clothing items: a Classic Shirt, Classic Pants, and a Classic T-Shirt. You export your project into an image file and feel excited to upload it directly to the Roblox Marketplace. As tempting as it is to rush the upload and see your creation live, this is the exact moment when many developers make a costly mistake. If you upload without testing, and later notice misalignment, stretching, clipping, or other imperfections, you’ve already spent Robux on something you now need to fix, re-export, and re-upload again. \n Even if you downloaded a template or asset using a service like Threadline, errors can still slip in during your editing process. A line may shift slightly, colors may not align perfectly at seams, or the torso area may distort unexpectedly. Any of these problems will force you to either accept a flawed product or pay again to correct it. Neither option is ideal. \n There is, however, a trusted workaround widely used by Roblox clothing developers: testing in Roblox Studio before uploading to the Marketplace. Normally, you would upload your image as a decal first, wait for Roblox to process it, open Roblox Studio, insert a character model, add shirt or pants objects, copy the decal ID into the appropriate template fields, and then preview your design directly on the avatar. If it looks wrong, you repeat the process—re-editing, re-exporting, re-uploading, re-waiting—again and again until the result is acceptable. \n This works, but it is inefficient and time-consuming. The real issue isn’t only wasted Robux; it’s wasted time and unnecessary repetition. \n That is where Threadline’s Avatar Correction Tool becomes useful. Instead of jumping between different Roblox systems, you simply upload your PNG file into the tool, and instantly view the clothing applied to a live character model. There is no waiting for decal moderation, no spending Robux on flawed uploads, and no juggling several open programs just to preview a single outfit. \n The Avatar Correction Tool provides three distinct sections: Classic Shirts, Classic Pants, and Classic T-Shirts. This means you can test all three clothing types in one environment without switching interfaces or uploading multiple files in different places. You can visually inspect how everything aligns, confirm that seams meet correctly, and make sure patterns display as intended. If something doesn’t look right, you simply fix your image and re-upload it to the tool until you are satisfied—without losing time or money in the process. \n The result is a smoother workflow, faster iteration, and much less frustration. Instead of guessing how your design will look in-game, you know ahead of time. Instead of feeling nervous before every upload, you can move forward confidently. \n So, what are you waiting for? Visit rbxthread.app, open the menu using the three lines in the top-right corner, and select “Avatar Correction” under the Tools section. From there, testing, viewing, refining, and improving your Roblox classic clothing becomes far easier and far more efficient. For anyone serious about Roblox Classic Clothing development, this simple step can save significant Robux, time, and stress—while helping you consistently produce clothing that both you and your customers will genuinely enjoy.",

        {"title": "How To Get Your Group To Reach New Members On Roblox", 
        "body": "Since Roblox’s recent advertising “update,” a significant number of features were removed—most notably the ability to promote anything other than games. Creators can no longer advertise groups, clans, or similar communities, and promoting clothing has also been disabled. This is especially frustrating given that the UGC update rolled out around the same time, allowing users to upload and distribute their own accessories, items, packages, and animations—yet removing any real way to give those creations visibility. \n That’s where Threadline Premium comes in. \n Threadline Premium allows you to promote your group, clothing, UGC items, or even your game directly to the entire Threadline community. No more jumping through hoops just to showcase something you’ve poured hours, days, or even weeks into—or a game that may have taken months to develop. Why spend hundreds of dollars or tens of thousands of Robux just to walk away with 500 visits, 10 likes, and zero returning users? \n Your product deserves space. \n Your time deserves recognition. \n And your ideas deserve a real chance to be seen. \n With Threadline Premium, we provide that space—consistently, all day, every day. There’s no favoritism and no popularity contest.

Visit https://rbxthread.app/, open the dropdown menu, click Sponsored Listings, and enter your Threadline Access Code. From there, you’ll be taken to a page with everything you need. Click Add Listing, select your content type (Clothing/UGC, Group, or Game), paste in the item ID, and you’re live to the entire Threadline community. You’ll also have access to impressions and click-through statistics, making it easy to track performance and understand what’s working. \n And the best part? It’s just $3.99/month, with the freedom to cancel anytime—no pressure, no lock-ins. \n Threadline is built for creators.
